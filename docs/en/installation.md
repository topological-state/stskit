# Installation

## Installation from Source Code

The following instructions apply to the current version of STSdispo (`master` branch in the repo).
The recommended Python version is 3.12. stskit is compatible with 3.10-3.12.

The following instructions are based on the recommended [uv package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). 
uv is a smart package manager that reduces the number of installation steps to a minimum. 
Other package managers (conda, pip) or the official [Python binaries](https://www.python.org/downloads/) using packages from [https://pypi.org/](PyPI) should work as well but will not be covered here.


### Step 1: Installing uv

Install uv according to [their installation instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).


### Step 2: Installing stskit

Download the STSkit source code from the Github repository. Users familiar with `git` may choose to clone the repository, all others should just download a [zip file](https://github.com/topological-state/stskit/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and unpack it to a directory of their choice.

### Step 3: Running Stellwerksim

Start a Stellwerk of your choice.

### Step 4: Running STSdispo

Open a terminal (or Powershell on Windows) and switch to the directory that contains `pyproject.toml`. Then run STSdispo:

```
uv run stsdispo.py
```

STSdispo will open its main window and connect to the locally running stellwerk. To terminate STSdispo, close the main window.
If the program does not start, you may need to sync the environment and retry:

```
uv sync
```

## Command Line Options

By default, STSdispo connects to the running stellwerk on the local host. To specify another host and/or port:

```
--host other-host --port 12345
```

By default, a log file `stskit.log` will be produced if errors are encountered. More verbose output can be generated by specifying a lower log level (WARNING, INFO or DEBUG). Example:

```
--log-level DEBUG --log-file mylog.log
```

Compiled binaries for the latest versions of Ubuntu (bin), Windows (exe) and MacOS (app) are provided _without warranty_ at the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/topological-state/stskit/releases/latest) page under _Assets_. Note that binaries are created automatically and not tested. In case of unknown problems, please report them and try with an older version.
